## The Simplest Game Engine

### Hello Guys!
I am so glad to see that you are interested in this project and reading this.
I was really afraid to start this project because I was not sure if I could make it work.

But Here we are today!

I made it work.. And It is just working.. You know?
Because I completed this project in a week, There are certainly some bugs, but I am not sure if they are all fixed. And the biggest of them is that You can't build the production, you can only work in the development.
using 

``` pnpm dev OR npm run dev ```

It is not the problem of the engine, but the problem of the bulid tool that I used.(ViteJS)


I will try to make it work in the future. But for now, I will just say that it is working.

**You can click the link below to see the basic documentation that I generated using the tsdocs, and It looks decent enought to at least read**

Alright Moving On..

This project basically contains the utilities that will help you to build your game or atleast minigame.
It uses the html canvas to draw the game frames.
Uses only a single thread of the CPU because javascript is single threaded programming language by default.

It contains classes like :
Vector, Particle, Shape, Rectangle (for collision), GameObject (only abstract class), Bezier Curves etc. that's it, also a few other classes that will help you to build your game and a utility object called utils.

I have put some working examples in the samples folder.
That contains : 
- Simulations
    - Solor System
    - Raining
    - Beziér Curve
- Games
    - Snake
    - Space Wars
    - Flappy Bird
- DSA Simulation
    - 0-1 Knapsack Problem

Alright Moving On..

All the code is open source and you can find it on github that you are probably reading this from.

The src folder contains the source code of the engine.
you will see a utils folder that contains all the utility classes.

You can use any build tool to implement it.

**BUT** 
**I Prefer that you don't use my game engine, because I want you to make your own game engine.**

**You got me!**

I will tell you this later that How can you make your own game engine? 
Alight.. That's it for this readme.
See ya.
